What this is

This file contains a CREATE TABLE statement to add the missing `reportes` table used by the backend Node/PHP controllers.

Why run it

The backend currently returns a MySQL error: "Table 'magnatesting_db.reportes' doesn't exist". Creating this table will allow `/api/reportes` routes to run and let the frontend save, list, and download reports.

How to apply (phpMyAdmin)

1. Open phpMyAdmin (usually at http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
2. Select the `magnatesting_db` database.
3. Go to the SQL tab and paste the contents of `create_reportes.sql` and execute.

How to apply (MySQL CLI / PowerShell)

Open PowerShell and run (adjust user/password/host as appropriate):

# Import file into magnatesting_db
mysql -u root -p magnatesting_db < "C:\xampp\xampp\FERDATA\database\create_reportes.sql"

If your MySQL server is on another host or port, add -h and -P flags. If you use a different DB user, replace `root` with that user.

Next steps after running

- Restart Node server (if necessary) and call GET /api/reportes to confirm it no longer errors.
- If your app expects a `url` to reference a generated PDF, implement the server-side PDF generation (Node or PHP) and save the generated file path/URL in the `url` column.

If you want, I can:
- Run this SQL for you (I will need DB credentials and permission), or
- Add a minimal Node endpoint to generate a PDF and return its URL (requires extra work).
